Hello, this is a simple template to make it easier to make your vehicle folders and keep them as organised as possible

Step 1: Add the Vehicles folder to you fivem server and go to your server.cfg and add (Rename this folder if you want)

ensure Vehicles

Step 2: Go into the stream folder and make a new folder in there that correlates to the vehicle for example. Aston Martin. From that add the stream files into the folder. Make sure it's a simple file name as this will be the vehicle spawn name for example for an Aston Martin DBX name it something like dbx.

Step 3: Go to the data folder and name the folder the exact same as the one from the stream folder. This isn't nessacary however, makes it a lot more organised when wanting to find the car to tweak or replace it.

Step 5: Add your model name to the "ModelNameHere" section in the vehicle_names.lua file. Then where it says InGameNameHere add the name you want it to be in game that appears in the bottom right when you enter a car in GTA. I have an Aston Martin DBX there as an example

Step 4: Go in game and test.

Hope this helped
